"""State data model for bmad-assist development loop.

This module defines the core data structures for tracking loop progress,
enabling crash recovery and resume functionality (FR4, FR34, NFR1).

State files are stored per-project at {project_root}/.bmad-assist/state.yaml.
This ensures each project has independent state tracking.

Usage:
    from bmad_assist.core.state import State, Phase, save_state, get_state_path
    from pathlib import Path

    # Create default (empty) state
    state = State()

    # Create state with values
    state = State(
        current_epic=3,
        current_story="3.1",
        current_phase=Phase.DEV_STORY,
        completed_stories=["1.1", "1.2"],
    )

    # Get state path for a project
    project = Path("/path/to/project")
    state_path = get_state_path(project_root=project)
    # Returns: /path/to/project/.bmad-assist/state.yaml

    # Save state atomically to YAML file
    save_state(state, state_path)

    # Serialize for YAML persistence
    data = state.model_dump(mode="json")

    # Deserialize from YAML data
    state = State.model_validate(data)
