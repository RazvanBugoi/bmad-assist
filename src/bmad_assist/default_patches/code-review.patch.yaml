  name: "code-review-optimizer"
  version: "1.1.0"
  author: "Pawel N"
  description: "Optimizes code-review workflow for Multi-LLM automation - removes interactive steps, produces code review report to stdout only"

compatibility:
  bmad_version: "6.0.0-alpha.22"
  workflow: "code-review"
  # NOTE: This patch is compatible with the 6-step code-review workflow (customized with Evidence Score)
  # Steps: 1 (file discovery), 2 (attack plan), 3 (adversarial review),
  #        4 (Evidence Score assessment), 5 (findings + fixes), 6 (status sync)

  # === STEP REMOVAL (handled by compiler) ===
  # Original workflow has 6 steps (customized with Evidence Score system):
  #   1. Load story and discover changes (file/git discovery)
  #   2. Build review attack plan
  #   3. Execute adversarial review
  #   4. Systematic Code Quality Assessment (Evidence Score, substeps 4a-4l)
  #   5. Present findings and fix them (has output block + ask element)
  #   6. Update story status and sync sprint tracking

  # NOTE: Step removal and renumbering is now handled deterministically by post_process rules.
  # Original workflow has 6 steps, steps 1 and 6 are removed, remaining steps 2-5 renumbered to 1-4.
  - "Remove step 1 completely - all file discovery and git diff analysis is handled by the compiler which embeds story file, modified source files, architecture, and project context in the <context> section"
  - "Remove step 6 completely - story status updates and sprint-status.yaml sync are handled by the orchestrator after synthesis; validator only produces a report"
  - "CRITICAL: KEEP steps 2, 3, 4, and 5 WITHOUT content modifications - these contain the core adversarial review logic and Evidence Score system"
  - "In step 5 (becomes step 4 after renumbering): Remove the ask block (XML tag 'ask') asking user for fix options, and remove all check blocks with user choice conditions - validator cannot interact with user"
  - "In step 5 (becomes step 4 after renumbering): KEEP the output block (XML tag 'o') containing the code review report template - this is the validator's output format"

  # === REFERENCE UPDATES ===
  - "Replace all {installed_path} references with 'embedded context' - compiler pre-loads all needed files"
  - "Replace the <critical> that says 'You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml' with: 'All configuration and context is available in the VARIABLES section below. Use these resolved values directly.'"

  # === OUTPUT FILE PATH (REMOVED - orchestrator handles saving) ===
  # NOTE: In Multi-LLM architecture, validators do NOT write files.
  # The orchestrator captures stdout and saves reports with anonymized IDs.
  - "Remove any references to default_output_file - validators output to stdout only"
  - "Remove any instructions to create directories or write files"
  - "Remove any instructions to save story files or update story status"

  # === SCOPE LIMITATION (READ-ONLY) ===
  - "Add ONE CRITICAL instruction at workflow start (first element after <workflow>): 'SCOPE LIMITATION: You are a READ-ONLY VALIDATOR. Output your code review report to stdout ONLY. Do NOT create files, do NOT modify files, do NOT use Write/Edit/Bash tools. Your stdout output will be captured and saved by the orchestration system.'"

  # === STEP 5 SIMPLIFICATION (stdout output only) ===
  - "In step 5 (Present findings, becomes step 4 after renumbering), simplify to: (1) Generate the code review report using the output block template (the 'o' XML element) as FORMAT GUIDE, (2) Replace all {{placeholders}} with actual values from your analysis, (3) Output the complete report to stdout, (4) Do NOT save to any file - orchestrator handles persistence"

  # === REPORT EXTRACTION MARKERS (critical for Multi-LLM) ===
  - "Add a <critical> instruction in step 5 (Present findings, becomes step 4) with EXACT text: 'OUTPUT MARKERS REQUIRED: Your code review report MUST start with the marker <!-- CODE_REVIEW_REPORT_START --> on its own line BEFORE the report content, and MUST end with the marker <!-- CODE_REVIEW_REPORT_END --> on its own line AFTER the final line. The orchestrator extracts ONLY content between these markers. Any text outside the markers (thinking, commentary) will be discarded.'"

  # === PLACEHOLDER HANDLING ===
  - "Replace {{fixed_count}} with literal '0' - validators do not fix issues"
  - "Replace {{action_count}} with literal '0' - validators do not create action items"

# Post-process rules extend defaults.yaml
# NOTE: These run AFTER LLM transforms, on final .tpl.xml output
# IMPORTANT: Order matters! User interaction removal MUST happen before end marker insertion
